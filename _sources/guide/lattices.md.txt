# Reading and expanding lattices

The `parse_and_expand_pals` entry point reads a PALS lattice
file, resolves any files it includes, and expands the lattice line into an
ordered list of elements. It returns a `Lattices` value with five independent
views of the document:

- **`original`** — the lattice exactly as written, one entry per file read.
- **`combined`** — the lattice after its `include`d and `load`ed files have been
  merged in.
- **`full_expanded`** — the fully expanded root lattice, with lines resolved into
  a flat ordered sequence of elements and every dependent parameter computed.
- **`expanded`** — the same lattice with the computed parameters pruned, leaving
  what the author wrote.
- **`adjunct`** — everything else the document contained.

Each view is an ordinary `YAMLNode`, so everything in
[Parsing and writing YAML](parsing.md) applies to it.

## The expanded views and `adjunct`

Expansion picks one lattice — the root lattice — and resolves it. The two
expanded views hold *only* that result, and are rooted at the lattice entry
itself, without the `PALS:`/`facility:` scaffolding the lattice was written
under:

```yaml
lat1:
  kind: Lattice
  branches:
    - main_line:
        ...
```

so the lattice is reached as `lat.full_expanded["lat1"]`, not through
`["PALS"]["facility"]`.

Everything the root lattice did not absorb stays in `adjunct`, which *does*
keep the full `PALS:`/`facility:` document: element and beamline definitions,
`use` statements, constants and variables, `Controller`s, `set` commands, and any
`Lattice` other than the one expanded. Definitions that expansion substituted
into the lattice are copied rather than moved, so they appear in both views — the
definition in `adjunct`, its inlined copy in the expanded lattice.

## `full_expanded` and `expanded`

`full_expanded` is the lattice with everything it implies worked out: each
element carries its `ReferenceP`, `FloorP` and `s_position`, the derived members
of every parameter family it uses (`Kn1L` alongside `Kn1`, `voltage` alongside
`gradient`, …) and the non-zero defaults of the groups it carries, and each
branch is capped with a `branch_end` `Placeholder` holding its final reference
and floor.

`expanded` is that same tree with all of it pruned: a parameter is kept only
when the author wrote it (or a post-`expand_lattice` `set` wrote it). It is
`full_expanded` with nodes removed rather than an earlier snapshot, so a
parameter present in both holds the *same* value in both, with every `set` and
ABSOLUTE controller applied.

Which to reach for:

- **`full_expanded`** to ask what the lattice *is* — placement, reference
  energy, or any parameter derived from another. `match_names` and
  `parameter_value` search it for that reason.
- **`expanded`** to see the inputs rather than their consequences, or to write a
  lattice back out without the computed values.

## Basic use

```python
import palsparserpy as pp

lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")

print(pp.to_yaml_string(lat.original))
print(pp.to_yaml_string(lat.combined))
print(pp.to_yaml_string(lat.full_expanded))
print(pp.to_yaml_string(lat.expanded))
print(pp.to_yaml_string(lat.adjunct))
```

To expand a single named lattice from a file that defines several, pass its
name as the second argument:

```python
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml", "main_ring")
```

## Reporting problems

Expanding a lattice can hit problems that are not fatal but are worth knowing
about: a `line` that references an element which was never defined, an
`inherit`/`repeat`/`Fork` whose target is missing, or an expression that could
not be evaluated (an unknown constant, a dangling element-parameter reference, a
dependency cycle). Rather than abort, expansion keeps going — leaving the
offending value as text — and collects a list of every such problem.

The `problems` argument controls what is done with that list:

```python
# Default: print the problems to stderr (nothing prints when there are none).
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")

# Write the problems to a file instead, printing nothing.
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml", problems="problems.txt")

# Say nothing at all.
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml", problems="none")
```

`"print"` and `"none"` are the two reserved names; any other value is taken as
the path of the file to write.

A typical report looks like:

```text
parse_and_expand_pals: 2 problem(s) encountered during lattice expansion:
  - ERROR: reference to undefined element or line 'NoSuchElement'
  - ERROR: could not evaluate expression for BendP.edge_int2: 0.02 * thingB>MagneticMultipoleP.NotThere
```

### Reading the list programmatically

Whatever the reporting mode, the same list comes back in `lat.problems` as a
list of `Problem`, so `"none"` still lets you inspect it. Each entry carries more
than its `message`:

- `path` — where it was found (`"q1>ApertureP.shape"`), empty when the problem
  is not tied to one spot.
- `severity` — `PROBLEM_ERROR` when the trees can no longer be trusted around
  the fault, `PROBLEM_WARNING` when expansion produced a sound result anyway.
- `origin` — `PROBLEM_INPUT` when your lattice is what needs fixing,
  `PROBLEM_UNSUPPORTED` when it is valid PALS that PALSParserCpp does not implement
  yet, and `PROBLEM_UNSPECIFIED` when the PALS standard does not define the
  case, so nothing was invented.

The last one is the one to filter on before failing a build, since editing the
lattice can only ever clear a `PROBLEM_INPUT`:

```python
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml", problems="none")

mine = [p for p in lat.problems if p.origin is pp.PROBLEM_INPUT]
if mine:
    raise SystemExit(f"{len(mine)} problem(s) to fix:\n" +
                     "\n".join(f"  {p}" for p in mine))
```

Only values that look like expressions (an operator, a parenthesis, an
element-parameter `>` reference, or an explicit `expr(...)`) are flagged when
they fail to evaluate; a plain name, label, or boolean that happens not to be a
number is left alone.

## Relative includes

Include paths inside a lattice file are resolved relative to the working
directory when the C library opens them. If your lattice `include`s other files
by relative path, change into the lattice directory first:

```python
import contextlib
import os

@contextlib.contextmanager
def chdir(path):
    old = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(path)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(old)

with chdir("lattice_files"):
    lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")
```

(On Python 3.11 and newer, `contextlib.chdir` does this for you.)

## Correspondence between the views

The derivation-chain trees describe the same lattice at successive stages of
processing, so most of their nodes correspond: the constant `a_const`, for
instance, exists in `original`, in `combined`, and — since it is not part of the
lattice — in `adjunct`. `node_correspondence` builds that mapping: given any
node, it returns the nodes it corresponds to in the other views.

```python
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")
corr = pp.node_correspondence(lat)
```

The result is a `dict` keyed by `YAMLNode`. Looking up a node returns a named
tuple whose fields — `original`, `combined`, `full_expanded`, `adjunct` — are
each a list of `YAMLNode` listing the corresponding nodes in that view:

```python
a_const = lat.combined["PALS"]["facility"][0]["constants"]["a_const"]

corr[a_const].original        # [ the a_const node in the original tree ]
corr[a_const].adjunct         # [ the a_const node in the adjunct tree ]
corr[a_const].full_expanded   # [] -- the lattice never referenced it
```

The queried node is included in its own view's list, so the four lists together
form the complete set of nodes that correspond to one another. You can look a
class up starting from *any* of those four trees and get the same result:

```python
corr[corr[a_const].original[0]] == corr[a_const]   # True
```

Because expansion splits the document, a `combined` node can reach
`full_expanded`, `adjunct`, or both. A beamline named by the root lattice is a
good example: its definition stays in `adjunct` while a copy of it is inlined
into the expanded lattice, and both belong to the same class.

The `expanded` view takes no part in the correspondence: it is a pruned copy of
`full_expanded` rather than a step in the derivation chain, so a node in it is
found by the path it sits at, not by a recorded link.

### One-to-many correspondences

Expansion can turn a single node into several — a `repeat` unrolls a line, an
`inherit` copies fields in, a bare element name is substituted with its full
definition, and a fork spawns a new branch. The correspondence follows every
copy, which is why each field is a *list*: one `combined` node can map to many
`full_expanded` nodes.

```python
# The sub-line repeated inside inj_line appears once in `combined`
# but several times in `full_expanded`.
for node, cls in corr.items():
    if len(cls.combined) == 1 and node == cls.combined[0] and \
            len(cls.full_expanded) > 1:
        print("combined node →", len(cls.full_expanded), "expanded copies")
```

A list is empty when a view has no corresponding node. For example, the
`destination_pointer` scalar that expansion synthesises exists only in
`full_expanded`, so its `original` and `combined` lists are empty; a constant
the lattice never refers to exists only in `adjunct`, so its `full_expanded`
list is empty.

:::{note}
**The mapping is exact, not heuristic.** The correspondence is not recovered by
re-matching the finished trees. The views are built as a derivation chain
(`original` → `combined` → `full_expanded` and `adjunct`), and the provenance of
every node is recorded as it is copied. `node_correspondence` reads back that
recorded provenance, so the mapping is exact even where nodes are duplicated,
merged, or renamed during expansion.
:::

A runnable version of these examples is in `examples/node_correspondence.py`.

## Matching constructs by name

Once a lattice is expanded, `match_names` finds every named construct that a
PALS *Name Matching* string refers to — elements, parameter groups, parameters,
constants, and variables — and returns them as a list of `YAMLNode`. The syntax
is:

```text
[{lattice}>>>][{branch}>>][{kind}::]{name}[>{group}.{subgroup}. … .{parameter}]
```

`{lattice}`, `{branch}`, and `{name}` are [PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org) patterns
matched against the *whole* name (anchored at both ends), so `B1.*` matches `B1a`
and `B1b` but `B1` on its own matches neither. `{kind}` is matched exactly, and
the dotted parameter path after the single `>` is matched exactly, key by key.
An omitted or empty pattern matches every name at that level, and `{branch}`
matches an element if any enclosing BeamLine/Branch name matches — so elements in
sub-lines are included.

```python
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")

# The `e1` bend parameter of every element whose name begins with `B1`:
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "B1.*>BendP.e1")

# Restrict to an element kind with `::`:
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "Quadrupole::.*>length")

# Restrict to a named beamline/branch (`>>`) or lattice (`>>>`):
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "inj_line>>Q.*>length")
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "ring>>>inj_line>>Q.*>length")

# Omit the parameter path to match the element itself, or the group:
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "Q1a")             # the element node
pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "Q1a>BendP")       # a parameter-group node
```

Pass any node of the tree you want to search — `lat.full_expanded` for beamlines
and elements, since those are only fully realised after expansion. The returned
nodes belong to that same tree, so you can read or modify them in place:

```python
for n in pp.match_names(lat.full_expanded, "B1.*>BendP.e1"):
    n.set_scalar("0.0")   # zero the entrance-face angle of each B1… bend
```

### Constants and variables

Lattice parameters include constant and variable names. A *bare* name — no
lattice/branch/kind qualifier and no parameter path — also matches every
constant and variable defined directly under the `PALS` or `facility` node, in
both the full (`kind: constant` / `kind: variable`) and compact
(`constants:` / `variables:` list) forms.

Constants and variables are defined at facility level rather than inside the
lattice, so they are found in `lat.adjunct` — searching `lat.full_expanded` for
one matches nothing, as the `PALS`/`facility` node it lives under is not part of
that tree:

```python
pp.match_names(lat.adjunct, "a_const")   # one named constant
pp.match_names(lat.adjunct, "a_.*")      # every constant/var named a_…
```

For a compact-form entry the matched node is the `name: value` scalar; for a
full-form entry it is the named node, underneath which `kind`/`value` live.

:::{note}
**Not yet implemented.** The full *Element Name Matching* grammar also defines
`#N` instance selection, `{e1}:{e2}` ranges, `,` unions, and `&` intersections.
These are not yet handled by `match_names`.
:::

Results are de-duplicated and returned in document order, and a malformed
pattern yields an empty list. A runnable version of these examples is in
`examples/match_names.py`.

## Reading a parameter value

Where `match_names` returns the *nodes* a string refers to, `parameter_value`
returns the single *value* a parameter holds. It takes the whole expanded lattice
`lat` and the same *Name Matching* syntax, and returns a `float`, a `str`, or
`None`. Like `match_names`, the string names either an element parameter (with a
parameter path) or, as a *bare* name, a constant or variable:

```python
lat = pp.parse_and_expand_pals("ex.pals.yaml")

pp.parameter_value(lat, "lat1>>>B1a>BendP.e1")        # 0.1    (from full_expanded)
pp.parameter_value(lat, "F1>ReferenceP.species_ref")  # '#3He' (a string)
pp.parameter_value(lat, "Q1>BendP.g")                 # 0.0    (unset → default)
pp.parameter_value(lat, "Q1")                         # None   (not a value)
pp.parameter_value(lat, "a_const")                    # a constant (from adjunct)
```

`parameter_value` searches only two of `lat`'s five views: `lat.full_expanded`,
which holds the element parameters, and then, if the name is not found there,
`lat.adjunct`, which holds the facility-level constants, variables, and any
definitions not spliced into the lattice. The raw `lat.original` and
`lat.combined` views are **not** searched, and neither is `lat.expanded`: a
dependent parameter is a legitimate thing to ask for, and only `full_expanded`
carries one.

Because both searched views are post-expansion, values come back already
evaluated — a numeric value as a `float`, and a non-numeric one (a species name,
or an expression expansion left unevaluated such as one using `random()`)
verbatim as a `str`:

- **Element parameter, set** — its value: a `float`, or a `str` when
  non-numeric.
- **Element parameter, unset** — an element that exists but does not set the
  parameter yields the parameter's default. That default is `0.0` for every
  parameter for now; real per-parameter defaults come later.
- **Constant or variable** — a bare name yields its value, the same way.
- **Unidentified** — `None`, when the name matches nothing in either view, is a
  bare element (an element has no single scalar value), stops on a whole
  parameter group rather than a single value, or several matches disagree on the
  value. (Matches that *agree* — the same element reused, or several that all
  take the default — collapse to the one shared value.)

:::{note}
**Defaults are provisional.** Because there is no parameter schema yet, an unset
parameter and a name that is not a real parameter are indistinguishable, so both
return the `0.0` default rather than `None`. When defaults arrive, an unknown
parameter name will return `None` instead.

## Command-line driver

`examples/read_pals.py` is a small runnable program that wraps the above: it
reads a lattice, expands it, and prints all five views.

```console
python examples/read_pals.py
```

Place your lattice files under `lattice_files/`.
